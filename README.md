Jot: Word Processor and Library
Version 0.1.0

Documentation
-----------------
Word processor and library for note keeping. Notes are saved asynchronous and intelligently upon library browsing as JSON objects, neatly tucked away within the very minimalistic application resource folder to peacefully roam the magical and far away land of AppData.

Planned features include means to group and archive notes while maintaining searchability.

Current Build
-----------------
Self-contained x86 application bound to run on pretty much whatever toaster with .exe support.
